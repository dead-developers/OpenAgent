## ðŸš€ Overview

OpenAgent is a sophisticated dual-model AI agent system that leverages multiple LLMs with smart routing for enhanced reasoning, problem-solving, and autonomous task execution. Built as an evolution of the OpenManus framework, OpenAgent brings advanced capabilities including self-learning, conflict reconciliation, and parallel processing to deliver a powerful, adaptive AI agent solution.

The system features a vector knowledge store for persistent memory and contextual retrieval, enabling continuous improvement through reinforcement learning and knowledge retention across sessions.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Dual-Model Architecture**: Combines a primary code-generating model (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 via Hugging Face) with a reasoning support model (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 via Hugging Face) to deliver optimal performance across different task types
- **Smart Model Routing**: Intelligently routes requests between models based on performance metrics
